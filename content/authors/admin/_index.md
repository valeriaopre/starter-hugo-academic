My name is **Valeria Opre**, I am 24 years old and I grew up in the German speaking region of Italy, South Tyrol. I went to the Italian highschool *Liceo Scientifico Torricelli*.

\
I decided to move out and live in Vienna, where i first completed my Bachelors in *Political Science* and then graduated with honours in *Business, Economics and Social Sciences* at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. During this time I had the great chance to do an exchange semester at the SMU in Singapore.

Before applying for my postgraduate studies in London I decided to pursue two internships to better shape my future goals: 

* As a *research consultant* for **Action Institute**, a renowned economic and political NGO in Milan 
* As an *equity analyst* for **Wutis**, winning two pitching competitions with McKinsey.

Arriving to London for my Masters at LBS I am excited to learn more programming languages and how to use them to make more strategic business decisions!
