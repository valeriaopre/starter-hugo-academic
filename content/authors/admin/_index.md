I am 25 years old and I grew up in the German-speaking region of Italy, South Tyrol. I went to an Italian high school and then moved to Austria, where I first completed my Bachelors in *Political Science* and then graduated with honours in *Business, Economics and Social Sciences* at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. During this time I had the great chance to do an exchange semester at the SMU in Singapore.

Before applying for my postgraduate studies in London I decided to pursue two internships to better shape my future goals: 

* As a *research consultant* for **Action Institute**, a renowned economic and political NGO in Milan 
* As an *equity analyst* for **Wutis,** I won two pitching competitions with McKinsey.

Arriving in London for my Master at LBS I am excited to learn more programming languages and how to use them to make more strategic business decisions!
